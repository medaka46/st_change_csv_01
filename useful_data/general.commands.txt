    Using pipreqs for Minimal requirements.txt
        If you want to generate a requirements.txt file that includes only the packages your project actually imports, you can use pipreqs:
    Install pipreqs:
        pip install pipreqs
    Generate requirements.txt: (Go to project folder then)
        pipreqs .
    This will create a requirements.txt file with only the packages that are imported in your project files.
